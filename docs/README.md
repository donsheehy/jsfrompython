# jsfrompython
A Guide to Learning Javascript for Python Programmers.

The guide is in a very crude state right now.
Much still needs to be written.
The idea is to illustrate JS syntax by translating from Python.

The basic plan is to cover
- basic control flow, variables, and functions
- object-oriented programming in JS
- some worked examples of data structures
- functional programming in JS
- working with the DOM
- event-driven and asynchronous programming in JS
