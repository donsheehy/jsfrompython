# Working with the DOM

Javascript thrives in the browser.
Webpages have a hierarchical structure called the DOM.

JS is commonly used in **event-driven programming**.
This is the usual case in a webpage, where user clicks or actions trigger events.
Those events should be JS function calls.
We will see how that happens.

This section will cover:
- What is the DOM
- Common Events
- JQuery to traverse the DOM
- D3 for data in the DOM
- AJAX and JSON
- React
